# 0x90's Rust Spot 

This is my little corner for messing around with Rust. Just jotting down notes, testing stuff, and maybe whipping up some projects as I go.  

## What’s Inside?  
- 🧠 Brain dumps on Rust basics  
- 📝 Random code snippets & tests  
- 🔧 Mini projects & exercises  
- 💥 Maybe some bigger builds if I level up  

This is just me figuring things out, but if you dig Rust too, feel free to lurk. 👀

**Why Rust?**  
Rust is dope—fast, safe, and makes you think differently about memory. I’m diving in to see what the hype’s about and how it stacks up against other languages.

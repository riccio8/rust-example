## Sled vs SQL vs Other Rust DB Crates (RocksDB, SeaORM, Rbatis)

---

Recently, I needed to integrate a **database** into a Rust application. Exploring the ecosystem, I encountered several options: from traditional **SQL-based crates** like *Diesel* and *SQLx*, to embedded key-value stores such as **RocksDB**, and more lightweight solutions like **Sled**. Each option offers different trade-offs in terms of **performance**, *ease of use*, **scalability**, and **flexibility**.

---

After testing and researching, I realized why **Sled** stands out for *embedded*, **high-performance**, and **safe data storage** in Rust applications. Below is a comparison of **Sled** against other common Rust database crates to help clarify the differences and why [**Sled**](https://docs.rs/sled/latest/sled/) could be the ideal choice depending on your project needs.

Sled guarantees [crash-safety](https://github.com/spacejam/sled/blob/main/SAFETY.md) by using a lock-free, append-only log structure and supports [atomic batch operations](https://docs.rs/sled/latest/sled/struct.Batch.html), making it ideal for concurrent embedded use

---

| Feature | **Sled** | **SQL-based Crates (Diesel, SQLx)** | **Other Rust DB Crates (RocksDB, SeaORM, Rbatis)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Performance** | High for embedded use; optimized for fast writes and reads | Depends on DB backend (Postgres, SQLite), generally it's good | Varies: RocksDB is very fast for key-value, ORM layers add overhead |
| **Speed** | Very fast in-memory and disk-based operations | Moderate to fast, depends on SQL backend and query complexity | RocksDB fast for key-value, ORMs slower due to abstraction |
| **Safety** | Memory safe, leverages Rust ownership; crash-safe design | Depends on backend; Rust crates provide compile-time query safety | Varies: RocksDB bindings safe but lower-level; ORMs type-safe |
| **Scalability** | Designed for embedded/single-node; not distributed | Scales well with DB backend (e.g., Postgres scales well) | RocksDB scales for local data; ORM scalability depends on backend |
| **Size/Weight** | Very lightweight (~1 MB crate size); minimal dependencies | Heavier; depends on features and SQL backend libraries | RocksDB larger due to C++ dependency; ORMs add abstraction layers |
| **Flexibility** | Key-value store, no SQL, supports trees and complex data structures | Full SQL support, complex queries, joins | Varies: RocksDB key-value; ORMs offer flexible schema and querying |
| **Ease of Use** | Simple API for embedded use, less boilerplate | Steeper learning curve; need to understand SQL and ORM paradigms | Varies: RocksDB lower-level, ORMs easier for relational models |
| **Concurrency** | Lock-free design, supports concurrent reads/writes | Depends on backend and crate support | RocksDB supports concurrent access; ORMs depend on DB |
| **Use Case** | Embedded apps, local storage, fast persistent KV store | Web apps, complex querying, relational DB needs | Embedded key-value, ORM abstraction for relational DBs |
| **Maturity** | Actively developed, modern Rust idioms | Mature ecosystems (Diesel, SQLx widely used) | Varies widely; RocksDB bindings stable, some ORMs newer |

## Code snippet

Here‚Äôs a simple example showing how easy it is to open a **DB**, and **read**/**write** *data* using *Sled*.

```rust
use sled::Db;

fn main() -> sled::Result<()> {
    let db: Db = sled::open("my_db")?;
    db.insert(b"key", b"value")?;
    let value = db.get(b"key")?;
    println!("Got: {:?}", value);
    Ok(())
}
```

Instead, a *SQL* example from the [official documentation](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) looks like this:

```rust
use sqlx::postgres::PgPoolOptions;
// use sqlx::mysql::MySqlPoolOptions;
// etc.

#[async_std::main] // Requires the `attributes` feature of `async-std`
// or #[tokio::main]
// or #[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), sqlx::Error> {
    // Create a connection pool
    //  for MySQL/MariaDB, use MySqlPoolOptions::new()
    //  for SQLite, use SqlitePoolOptions::new()
    //  etc.
    let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
        .max_connections(5)
        .connect("postgres://postgres:password@localhost/test").await?;

    // Make a simple query to return the given parameter (use a question mark `?` instead of `$1` for MySQL/MariaDB)
    let row: (i64,) = sqlx::query_as("SELECT $1")
        .bind(150_i64)
        .fetch_one(&pool).await?;

    assert_eq!(row.0, 150);

    Ok(())
}
```

As you can see, it requires more configuration and async functions.

## When (and When Not) to Use Sled

**When to use Sled:**

* You need a **fast, embedded key-value store** for local storage in Rust applications.
    
* Your project requires **crash-safe, concurrent data access** without complex setup.
    
* You want a **lightweight, minimal-dependency database** that‚Äôs easy to integrate.
    
* Your application doesn‚Äôt require SQL queries or relational data modeling.
    
* You‚Äôre building **embedded systems, desktop apps, or small services** with local persistence.
    

**When not to use Sled:**

* You need **full SQL support** with complex queries, joins, and transactions.
    
* Your application requires a **distributed or scalable multi-node database**.
    
* You want to leverage existing **relational database backends** like Postgres or MySQL.
    
* You‚Äôre working in a **no\_std or bare-metal embedded environment**.
    
* Your project demands extensive **ORM features or schema migrations**.

## To summarize

**Sled** is a powerful option when you need **reliable**, **lightweight**, and **high-performance** local storage for Rust applications. It shines in scenarios where **simplicity, speed**, and **safety** matter more than SQL features or scalability. If your project doesn't need relational models or complex queries, sled might be the perfect tool for the job.
